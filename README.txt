How to publish for FREE:

Option A — GitHub Pages (recommended, full control)

2. Create a new repository (public), name it e.g., zain-ai-site
3. Upload the files (index.html, style.css, post1.html)
4. In repo Settings -> Pages, set Source to main branch / root folder -> Save
5. After a minute, your site will be live at https://<yourusername>.github.io/<repo-name> or on the root domain if you name the repo <yourusername>.github.io

Option B — Blogger (easier for AdSense)

2. Create a New Post -> Switch to HTML view -> Open post1.html in a text editor and copy its contents -> Paste into the post's HTML view -> Publish.
3. For homepage, Blogger creates it automatically. You can add pages (About, Contact) via Blogger UI.
